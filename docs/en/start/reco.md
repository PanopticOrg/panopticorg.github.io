# Recommendations

A third similarity tool is recommendations to complete an existing group.

You must first have grouped your images by a tag or multi-tag property and click on the "Image Proposal" button:

![Alt text](../images/reco1.png)

This then opens a list of image proposals similar to all images in the source group. You can then either validate or refuse each image. By validating an image, it will be added to the group by assigning the group's tag to it.
