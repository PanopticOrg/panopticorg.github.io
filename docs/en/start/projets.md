# Projects

Panoptic allows you to work with your corpora locally on your computer. Panoptic therefore does not offer predefined image collections; datasets must be constituted upstream.

All actions performed within a project are automatically saved locally on your computer. If you close a project and return to it later, you will find all the actions you performed there.

Panoptic allows you to work with as many projects as you wish.

In a project, you can work with several image corpora if you wish, imported at once or in several steps.

## Panoptic Project Management Page

Projects are managed on a dedicated page (creation, import, deletion), which is Panoptic's home page: it opens when the software is launched and remains accessible at any time.
            
On the project management page, click on "Create" next to "Create a new project."

This involves defining the location on your computer – (the "folder") – where you want to save your project.

!!! Warning
    You must not move this folder/rename its path afterwards.
    
    Create this folder in a different folder from the one containing your image corpus.
    
    We recommand creating a parent folder to hold all your panoptic projects.

Then name your project in the "Project Name" field.

Finally, click "Create": your project is created and the Panoptic workspace opens.
