# Tips and Shortcuts

This section aims to list some keyboard shortcuts and usage tips to facilitate the use of Panoptic.

## Shortcuts

!!! note

    On Mac, CTRL is replaced by Command

- **ctrl + z:** undo,
- **ctrl + alt + z:** redo,
- **ctrl held while hovering over an image:** displays an enlargement of an image,
- **shift-click selection:** selects all images between the first and last selected image,
- **ctrl-click selection:** selects an image without canceling the current selection
- **tab when annotating an image:** moves to annotating the same property on the next image,
- **enter validates most actions (annotation, clusters, execute etc.)**

## Tips

- when performing a text similarity search, if you enter an image URL instead of text, Panoptic will download this image and perform an image similarity search on this external image.
